Thank you for downloading Police Department 3.0, I hope you enjoy the assets.

I have included 2 versions of Structure_02

Gamma and Linear Color Space version.

Gamma are using the default unity settings, in order to view Linear as intended, please open the image doc labled Structure 2 Scene Linear Color Settings and follow its settings.

You can follow me on twitter, @SojaExiles  in order to be notified of new and free packages on the Unity Asset Store.

If the package is to your liking, please leave a rating on the assets page.  

It will help me out a lot so I can bring even more robust packages to the asset store.   

Email me your ideas on what I should work on next.

If you have any questions or issues, please e-mail me at Support@sojaexiles.com

Thank you!
